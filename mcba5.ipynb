    "You can see in the plots that this program generates that the telescope initially accelerates to a maximum slew speed of about 2 degrees per second, it then switches to a different algorithm when it is about 10 arcminutes from the final position, and then approaches the final position exponentially (hence the straight line in the log/lin plot). The noise between 60 and 70 seconds gives an idea of the tracking precision of the telescope mounting."
