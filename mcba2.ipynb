Finally, it is *homogenous*, meaning that the RHS is zero (there is no forcing function).\n",

There are more efficient ways of solving the gravitational problem, even involving special-purpose hardware such as the GRAPE computers. Recently, GPUs(graphical processing units, developed primarily for video games) are taking over as the engine of choice for state-of-the-art computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You are also likely to need to vary the timestep, so that you capture behaviour accurately when interactions are happening rapidly (on timescales of days for close binary stars, up to billions of years).\n",

    "- The solar system is unstable (in the sense that there could be major changes to the orbits, and possibly even the ejection of a planet) on timescales of 100s of millions (?) of years.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even the smallest delta in positions/velocities can lead to chaotic behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coping with large numbers (> 10,000) of particles is not for the faint-hearted. You need more particles than this for globular clusters, which can contain up to around a million stars. This has only been possible in the last decade.\n",
